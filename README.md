During COVID we all heard about people adoption & surrender rates in the news. Some were saying they both increased an others were saying that both decreased during the worst parts of COVID.

In this project we explored adoption and surrender rates in the City of Dallas to see what the truth actually is. Our original hopethesis is that adoption rates went up as COVID cases increased due to people being at home more often since things typically were shutdown. Also, surrender rates increased once COVID cases decreased since people were most likely having to go back into the office and not at home as much to take care of their pets.

We captured prior data to compare to the trend during the worst of the COVID pandemic and noticed that dog adoption rates were already pretty in the fiscal year 2019 and also that cat adoptions were increasing significantly toward the end of the 2019 fiscal year.
