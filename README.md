# Adoption/Surrender Rates vs COVID Cases

During COVID, we all heard about dog/cat adoption & surrender rates in the news. Some said they both increased, while others said the rates decreased during the worst parts of COVID.

In this project, we explored adoption and surrender rates in the City of Dallas to see what the truth is. Our original hypothesis is that adoption rates increased as COVID cases increased due to people being at home more often since things typically were shut down. Also, surrender rates increased once COVID cases decreased since people went back into the office and did not have as much time at home to take care of their pets.

First, we found that the City of Dallas had an API, so we pulled data from the 2018 fiscal year to the 2022 fiscal year and cleaned up the data to have two separate data frames for cats and dogs. Lastly, we visualized our data to compare adoption/surrender rates for cats and dogs.

We captured prior data to compare the trends during the worst of the COVID pandemic and noticed that dog adoption rates were already pretty in the fiscal year 2019 and that cat adoptions were increasing significantly toward the end of the 2019 fiscal year.

We see that adoption rates and surrender rates plummeted when COVID cases started in Texas in March and continue to decrease as cases increased. They start to pick back up when cases decreased but then decreased when there was a spike in COVID cases at the end of 2021.

Looking at the adoption/surrender data, while COVID cases are on a downward trajectory, the data remains relatively flat and does not get back to the rates we have seen before the COVID pandemic.

Lastly, we looked to see if there was any correlation between COVID cases and dog/cat adoption and surrender rates. Based on our findings, there is a slight negative correlation between the two since both of our lines have a negative slope.
